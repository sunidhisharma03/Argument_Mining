## Argument Mining

Argument Mining is an NLP technique that automatically identifies argument components such as premises and conclusions within text. It helps uncover the logical structure of arguments, especially in complex documents like legal cases or academic papers. This makes it easier to analyze reasoning, support claims, and understand persuasive discourse at scale.
